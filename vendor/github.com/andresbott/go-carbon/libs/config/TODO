* read config dirs
* user space config in .config
    * write
* defaulf config location to populate defaults to file
* dont fail if config path does not exist ( option to make config file optional/mandatory)
* allow multiple files to be overlaid

* in the options option to specifi a file as key value and have that loaded
    e.g. to load a secret from file

* read envs
*unmarshal slieces of structs


* why i dont use viper:
 - not really possible to make a 12 factor confit to unmarshal
 - not possible to unmarshal config sections
 - does not support config.d pattern
 - i wanted to add validation like required



doc:
* conventions

* points:
    * explicit init types passed to the Load function
* best practices
    * managing slices is complicated, e.g. overwriting a single one using an envs better create a config using maps
